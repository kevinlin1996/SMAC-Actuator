;Originally this was a for loop, I turned it into a while loop, since we do not need to restrict the amount of cycles this has, as it will eventually break out of the loop to be in position mode (this is not a conventional while loop I simply just Mj54 over and over until the counter condition allows the code to get to that Mj60);
